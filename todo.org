* Puzzle me this
  - Note taken on [2019-05-31 Fri 08:14] \\
    Why isn't it opening more files?  Specifically, no type request is
    going out for some local aliases?
* first goal should be to traverse

    Might look like taking any
    alias types
    -> running defintion finder
    -> gathering types from that file
* DONE Let's get this parsing with aeson
** DONE First we need to drop the first part of output
*** DONE Even more first, we need to make sure the messages are separated
* TODO Another step with the output to transform it into commands
  - Note taken on [2018-09-24 Mon 20:18] \\
    For now, let's keep it simple.
    1 - Push quickinfo commands to tsserver
    2 - Match on the replies and send to stdout
* DONE Improve parsing of navtree return command
* TODO From the range start to issueing commands
* TODO Use lenses to clean up record access
